To use the levitopy code from anywhere (either in python or a notebook) install it via pip.

For the latest version available on GitLab

```pip install git+https://gitlab.icfo.net/pno-trappers/levitopy```

To access the example notebooks, install `levitopy` as describe above and [download](https://gitlab.icfo.net/pno-trappers/levitopy/-/tree/master/images) the notebooks.
Alternatively you can clone the entire project.
